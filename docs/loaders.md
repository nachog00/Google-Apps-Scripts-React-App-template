# Loaders

There is a component named Loaders, where you can define many loaders, style them on the Loaders.css file (you can refactor all of this to have a loader per subFolder ).
This way you can import the Loaders component from any component and use it like this:

    import Loaders from '../components/Loaders';

And then chose the specific component you want to use:

    <Loaders.WholeWindow />
